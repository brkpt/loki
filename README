Last update: December 22, 2012

This repository has taken the Loki 0.1.7 and added support to be built on VS2013 and JamPlus.

To get JamPlus:
- Clone JamPlus from https://github.com/jamplus/jamplus.
- Follow the included directions to build and locate the JamPlus executables and
  associated modules.

To build the Loki test suite:
-----------------------------
- Run CreateVS2013Workspace.bat
- This will create a build\_workspace.vs2013_\Test.sln
- Load Test.sln into VS2013

You can then build and run any of Loki's test suite applications.  The test applications
build into test/bin.

To include Loki into an existing project:
-----------------------------------------
To include Loki into an existing Jam project, simply copy underneath an existing source
tree and SubInclude the Jamfile.loki.jam in your project.  You can then include Loki by 
including it in your Jam files via:

C.IncludeDirectories project : $(LOKI)/include ;
C.LinkLibraries project : Loki ;

To include Loki the in your source via:

#include "loki/file.h"

Loki notes:
-----------
Loki Sourceforge page: http://loki-lib.sourceforge.net/
Alexandrescu's Modern C++ site: http://www.moderncppdesign.com/

If you use the small object allocator directly or indirectly 
(through the Functor class) you must add src/SmallObj.cpp to your 
project/makefile.

If you use Singletons with longevity you must add 
src/Singleton.cpp to your project/makefile.

If you use OrderedStatic.h with you must add 
src/OrderedSataic.cpp to your project/makefile.
